 int atoi(const char *nptr);
The atoi() function converts the initial portion of the string pointed to by nptr
to int. The behavior is the same as
 strtol(nptr, NULL, 10);
except that atoi() does not detect errors.
The atol() and atoll() functions behave the same as atoi(), except that they con‚Äê
vert the initial portion of the string to their return type of long or long long.
atoq() is an obsolete name for atoll().
RETURN VALUE
The converted value.
